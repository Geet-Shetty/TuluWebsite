# TuluWebsite
Using the database created from TuluProject to have a basic dictionary website.

Tulu is a South Indian Language that is spoken by about 2 million people and is written using
the Tigalari alphabet. It was only recently that I started to learn to read and write in it. There
were many points where I thought a dictionary would be great to have. Currently, there is only
one online dictionary (tuludictionary.in) that has Tulu words and phrases written in Kannada
(another South Indian Language). Having the words and phrases not be written in the actual
Tulu letters was my biggest issue with the site along with it only having an exact search. Due to
the limitation of the technology at the time the site was created, these drawbacks are
understandable but were things I wanted to fix.
The goal of this project was to make a prototype website that displayed data in Tulu and
implemented some modern search features to make a better learning tool. I wanted to learn
some basic full-stack web development and this was a good chance to try doing a project that is
meaningful to me. I believe that going forward to preserve Tulu knowledge there has to be more
online tools available to aid people in learning the language, so making a newer dictionary site
is my way of helping preserve it.
